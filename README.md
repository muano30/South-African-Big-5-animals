I'm building the app about five big animals in south africa, The app will have pictures about the big Five animals and it will have the short story about the animal. 

I will have a dropdown menu on the right which have a list of animals that i will talk about, just lick on the list of the animal then it will take you to the animal you want ti read about.

If you hover on the picture the second picture will appear with the sound of that animal.
